# Step 1: Data Collection (Sample)
# Download weather and wildfire data from respective sources

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Clean, preprocess, and merge the datasets

# Step 3: Machine Learning Model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Step 5: Prediction
# Use real-time or forecasted weather data to predict wildfire path
new_weather_data = gather_realtime_weather()
predicted_path = model.predict(new_weather_data)
